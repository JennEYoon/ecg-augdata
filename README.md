Figures: Augmented vs original hospital, some samples stored in: ecg-augdata repo/ augments/aug_gemini/figures_aug_gemini/*.png  
Some show powerline 60hz interference. Others show all 12 ECG signals for normal patient. Will need to recreate useful example figures. Read literatuve to find gopd choices to display.
