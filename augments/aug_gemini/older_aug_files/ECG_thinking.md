Defining the Class Structure

My initial plan to generate Python code is solidifying. I'm focusing on creating a robust Python class structure to encapsulate the ECG data augmentation methods. This will be the foundational element for manipulating and transforming the ECG data. I'm currently defining the class's core functionalities.

Designing the simulate_lead_displacement

I'm now implementing the simulate_lead_displacement method within my ECGAugmenter class. The method will accept the 12-lead ECG signal as input and execute the lead displacement procedure, based on the document's instructions. Currently, I'm working through the logic to handle limb lead and precordial lead calculations separately.  I'm focusing on ensuring the random coefficients are correctly applied to the ECG data. I am using NumPy for signal manipulation.

Developing the ECGAugmenter Class

The ECGAugmenter class is taking shape! I've finalized the class structure and am now integrating the simulate_lead_displacement and simulate_noise methods. Both will take a 12-lead ECG signal as input. I'm focusing on the implementation of simulate_lead_displacement, particularly on incorporating the calculations and random coefficient application for both limb and precordial leads. I'll utilize NumPy for ECG data manipulation and ensure all steps align precisely with the provided documentation.

Of course. Here is a Python implementation of the augmentation strategy you outlined. I've created a class ECGAugmenter that encapsulates the logic for both lead displacement and noise simulation.

This code is designed to be easily integrated into a PyTorch data-loading pipeline. You can call the augment method on each raw ECG signal before it's passed to the model.
