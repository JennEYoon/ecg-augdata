To summarize:

Yes, you should generate a *much larger* augmented dataset from the public 12-lead ECGs to simulate your prototype’s characteristics. The key goals of augmentation here are to:

* Simulate **lead displacement** from fixed elastic shirt positions.
* Add **motion-induced and contact noise** typical in wearables.
* Replicate **physiological variation** and **morphological distortion** realistically.

This synthetic data will enable robust pretraining. Then, fine-tuning on your actual prototype data—however small—should significantly improve your model's generalization to real-world wearable ECGs.

If you want, I can help implement these augmentation routines in PyTorch or TensorFlow.
